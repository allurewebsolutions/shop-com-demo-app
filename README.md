# Shop.com Demo App by Mike Doubintchik

## Quick Demo
- [Expo]()

## Prerequisites
- Expo-cli must be installed
- Node version ^10.15

## How To Initialize
- Run `yarn` in project root

## How To Run Project
- Run `yarn start` in project root, which will open an Expo window in the browser
- Select to run in iOS simulator

## Features
- Login/Register - via Firebase
- List of Shop.com products (1st API use)
- Product detail page
- User profile with image from camera roll or camera (use native functionality)
- Redux with a persistent store

## Given more time, I would...
- Given more consideration to UI/UX, there is a lot of room for improvement
- Create a search bar that uses the products API to search for a given term
- Add pagination with infinite scroll on the product
- Refactor, add more comments, and make truly production ready code in all places of the app
- Create close to 100% test coverage
